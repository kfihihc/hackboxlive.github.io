<h2><a href="https://github.com/hackboxlive/Shakti-Chess">Shakti-Chess</a></h2>
<p>A chess playing bot that searches the best optimal move up to a depth. The chess engine uses various algorithms like Alpha-Beta prunning minimax, generating Zobrist keys,zero/null window search, principal variation search and many others. The move search and evaluation is still being worked upon to make the chess engine better and faster. The GUI has been written completely in JAVA using awt and swing frameworks. The engine itself has been written in C++ completely.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/hackboxlive/hackathon-resultapp">Result-App</a></h2>
