<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I am a 3rd year undergrad from NIT Hamirpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I like to code, think, and eat! I am fairly interested in Algorithmic puzzles and Competitive Programming. Solved more than 200 problems on <a href="https://www.spoj.com/users/shaktisingh">SPOJ</a> and bagged good ranks many a times on <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/mr_knownothing">Codechef</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforces.com/profile/mr_knownothing">Codeforces</a>, now I am actively looking for a good job which uniquely suites my interests. Feel free to contact me any time <a href="mailto:singhsarvshakti127@gmail.com">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Recently, I have started to explore the world of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and I have actually started to take quite fun in it.
  I like blogging and have started it recently, and they will, for now, mostly contain content about Competitive Programming and approaches to solve some programming problems.
</p>
<p>
  I love hanging out very much and have keen interest in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarv.shakti/">photography</a>. Welcome to my site. Thanx!
